        <h2>Self-Assessment Analysis</h2>
            
            <p>
            At the start of the semester, I wrote in my Letter to the Instructor that I wanted to improve my ability to communicate technical concepts to different audiences and strengthen my intercultural communication skills. My earlier communication experiences mostly came from computer science courses, student leadership, and my work on research teams. In those settings, I often realized that what made sense to me did not always make sense to others. For example, in a software engineering project involving evolutionary algorithms, my documentation only became effective after I reorganized the structure and added diagrams to help my teammates understand the workflow. Coming into this class, I wanted to turn those moments of “accidental clarity” into intentional communication strategies I could apply across different contexts. This course gave me the space to practice that deliberately.
            </p>

            Across the three major projects, I saw meaningful growth in how I consider rhetoric—especially audience, purpose, and context. In Major Project 1, the Job Portfolio, my goal was to speak directly to future employers. I revised my résumé bullets to sound more confident but accurate, highlighted results using quantifiable metrics, and built a dark-themed portfolio site that aligned with a professional, modern tone. In Major Project 2, my partner and I designed an Equifax crisis-communication poster targeting a public audience unfamiliar with cybersecurity terminology. We stripped away jargon, focused on clear headers, and redesigned the timeline to visually show how Equifax’s delayed communication worsened public trust. For Major Project 3, the phishing awareness toolkit, our audience was Georgia Tech students who often ignore security alerts. We developed short, actionable messages and a simple slide deck to make phishing cues memorable. Understanding how to adjust tone and design for different audiences became one of the biggest skills I developed.

            My process also changed significantly throughout the course. Before this class, I often treated a draft as a final piece unless someone pointed out confusion. Here, revision was expected and built in. For MP1, I reorganized my website layout, rewrote résumé sections based on peer feedback, and improved readability by adjusting spacing and typography. In MP2, our partner agreement shaped the collaboration structure—we divided tasks by strengths, and I took charge of poster design and editing while my partner focused on research. In MP3, our team charter established expectations, schedules, and accountability before writing anything. This made the work feel closer to a real workplace, and it taught me how communication structures improve collaborative outcomes.

            <p>
            Working across WOVEN modes strengthened my ability to choose the right medium for a message. MP1 required a combination of written content and a visually navigable website. MP2 involved charts, diagrams, summary boxes, and a poster designed to be readable from a distance. Presenting MP2 aloud pushed me to rely on visuals for clarity and keep verbal explanations concise. MP3 integrated slides, phishing examples, and simplified diagrams, which forced me to think about how students would interact with the materials on platforms like Outlook and Canvas. These multimodal tasks helped me understand communication as more than writing—it's about creating an ecosystem of meaning.

            Design became another major area of growth. In MP1, I learned how spacing, hierarchy, and contrast shape readability. In MP2, peer feedback helped me simplify our poster layout by eliminating unnecessary text, strengthening alignment, and clarifying color coding. In MP3, I used large icons, high-contrast colors, and short step-by-step instructions to help students identify phishing cues quickly. By the end of the course, I was intentionally making design decisions rather than relying on intuition, which made my communication more accessible and effective.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Overall, I believe I earned an A in this course because my work demonstrates consistent improvement, collaboration, and thoughtful application of rhetorical, multimodal, and design principles. I completed all major projects, revised my work based on feedback, and connected course strategies to real communication contexts—from research labs to student organizations. Most importantly, I can now explain why I make communication choices instead of relying on instinct. This semester helped me become a more adaptable and intentional communicator, and I will carry these skills forward into my academic, professional, and cross-cultural experiences, including my upcoming study-abroad program in Japan.
