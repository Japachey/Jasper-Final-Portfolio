        <h2>Self-Assessment Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                When I wrote my initial letter to you at the start of the semester, I said that I wanted to become better
                at explaining technical concepts to different audiences and to show more cultural adaptability in my work.
                Most of my earlier communication experience came from computer science courses and student clubs, where I
                learned that what makes sense in my own head does not always make sense to others. This portfolio shows
                how I built on that realization through three major projects that pushed me to be more intentional with
                audience, genre, and design.
            </p>
            <h3>Rhetoric: Adapting to Audience and Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                Across the course, I learned to think about rhetoric as a set of choices instead of something automatic.
                In my Job Portfolio (MP1), I framed my experiences for future employers by highlighting impact, using
                concise bullet points, and writing in a confident but clear tone. The Equifax poster (MP2) asked me to
                switch audiences: instead of recruiters or classmates, I had to explain a complex data breach to a general
                public audience that might not know technical vocabulary. My partner and I cut jargon, used bold headings
                such as “Abstract,” “Methods,” and “Results &amp; Recommendations,” and used color and graphs to show
                timelines and communication failures. For the Phishing Awareness Toolkit (MP3), we shifted again to a
                student audience at Georgia Tech who sees constant alerts and often ignores them. That project forced me
                to think about attention, overload, and how to keep messages short and actionable so students would
                actually remember the tips.
            </p>
            <h3>Process: Iteration, Feedback, and Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
                My process also changed significantly. Earlier in my CS work, I usually wrote things once and only fixed
                them when people were confused. In this class, revision was built into every major project. For MP1, I
                revised my résumé bullets and website language after peer feedback that some sections sounded too dense.
                I reorganized sections, made the headings more skimmable, and added a darker visual theme so the content
                felt more cohesive and professional. In MP2, our partner agreement helped us set clear roles: my main
                responsibility was design and editing, while my partner focused more on technical research. We met
                regularly, shared drafts in Google Docs, and rehearsed the presentation to tighten the timing and
                transitions. For MP3, our team charter formalized our workflow even more by setting internal deadlines,
                meeting schedules, and expectations for communication. That document kept us accountable and made it clear
                how to handle conflict or missed deadlines, which made the project feel more like a real workplace
                collaboration.
            </p>
            <h3>Modes &amp; Media: Working with WOVEN Communication</h3>
            <p>
                This class also pushed me to work across WOVEN modes—Written, Oral, Visual, Electronic, and Nonverbal.
                The MP1 website combines written content (résumé, project descriptions) with visual hierarchy, interactive
                navigation, and an electronic medium that can be shared with recruiters. For MP2, the poster and
                presentation layered written captions with charts, icons, and color-coded sections to make the Equifax
                case understandable at a glance. Presenting the poster aloud helped me practice pacing, gesture, and
                emphasis so that the spoken explanation matched the visual structure. MP3 integrated slides, infographics,
                and live demonstration links to phishing examples and AI detection tools. Together, these projects taught
                me how to move between modes and how each choice affects accessibility and comprehension.
            </p>
            <h3>Design: Accessibility, Clarity, and Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>
                Design became one of the main areas where I saw improvement. In MP1, I refined my portfolio layout to use
                consistent type hierarchy, clear spacing, and a high-contrast dark theme so that section headings and
                project cards are easy to scan. For the Equifax poster, I focused on grid alignment, white space, and
                consistent font sizes so that viewers could quickly follow the flow from Abstract to Methods, Conclusions,
                and Recommendations. Feedback from peers and from you encouraged us to simplify the color palette and
                avoid clutter, which made the final version more readable. In the phishing toolkit, I designed slides that
                used large icons, step-by-step flows, and scenario-based examples. We also thought about accessibility by
                using readable fonts, avoiding text-heavy slides, and making sure our colors had enough contrast.
            </p>
            <h3>Meeting My Initial Goals &amp; Grade Argument</h3>
            <p>
                Looking back at my initial letter, I feel that I achieved the main goals I set for myself. I am more
                comfortable explaining technical ideas, such as data breaches and phishing attacks, to non-CS audiences
                without oversimplifying the content. Through team projects, I also practiced intercultural and
                collaborative communication—skills that are important for my future plans to study abroad in Japan and
                work in international tech environments. I consistently completed major projects on time, engaged in group
                work, and revised my work based on feedback instead of treating drafts as final.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I believe I have earned an <strong>A</strong> in this course. My portfolio meets the expectations
                for the A range by presenting a complete, carefully revised set of major projects that address
